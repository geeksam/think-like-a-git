## Let's look at those examples <br /> one more time <br /> (but in a different order)

(These examples have a lot packed into them.<br />It's not important that you remember all of the terms.)
<br />

* 1) **Nodes**: places to be
* 2) **Edges**: ways to get between them

### 18th-Century KÃ¶nigsberg, Prussia
<img src="bridges_of_konigsberg.jpg">

**Nodes** = land masses

**Edges** = bridges

<br />For the purposes of his problem (crossing each bridge exactly once),

Euler condensed an entire land mass down to one point.

<br />Where you go while you're on an island doesn't matter...

if you're only concerned about which bridges you cross.

### The World (According to Facebook)
<br />
<img src="facebook_world_map.jpg" width="1000">

<br />
**Nodes** = cities with Facebook users

**Edges** = "Friend of" links between (lots of) people in those cities

<br />
Graphs can be quite **large**.

### Ladd's Addition
<img src="ladds_addition.jpg" height="400">

**Nodes** = intersections

**Edges** = streets

<br />I've drawn these streets as two-way.  (In reality, some are one-way.)

Graph theory calls two-way edges **undirected edges**

(and graphs with them are **undirected graphs**).

### Morrison Bridge
<img src="morrison_bridge.jpg" height="250">

**Nodes** = intersections (ish)

**Edges** = streets

<br />
Note that these edges are one-way.

Graph theory calls them **directed edges**

(and graphs with them are **directed graphs**).

<br />
We often say that a directed edge

(or, if we're being sloppy, the node it starts at)

"points to" another node.

### Social Networks
<img src="social_network.jpg">

**Nodes** = people

**Edges** = some kind of social tie (see labels)

<br />
I included this one to show another useful feature of graphs:

**We can attach information to nodes and edges.**

<br />
A more realistic social graph might be **directed**.

(For example, you might want to model the "has a crush on" relationship.)


!SLIDE center
### Family Tree (Ancestors)
<img src="family_tree.jpg" height="200">

**Nodes** = family members

**Edges** = "parent is" relationship

<br />
This kind of graph is called a **tree**.

(Trees show up everywhere in computer science.)

<br />
Running with the tree metaphor, the node at the "bottom" is called the **root node**.<br />
(But sometimes it's drawn at the top.)

<br />
Subsections of the tree are called **branches**.<br />(Where have I heard that before?)

<br />
Nodes that don't point to any other nodes are called **leaf nodes**.

### Some Sort of Sporting Event

It's not displayed the same way as the family tree, but it has the same properties.

### VisualThesaurus.com
<img src="visual_thesaurus.jpg">

By now, there's not much to say about this.

I mostly included it to define the "mathy" end of the continuum.

<br />The site is fun to play with, too.

## What's the Point?
* For me, learning about graphs was like taking psychedelics: <br /> it changed the way I looked at the world.
* <img src="whoa.png"> <br /> <span class="aside">(This slide probably says *way* more about me than you wanted to know.)</span>
* Once I learned about graph theory, I started seeing graphs everywhere, and I wanted to share that experience with you.
